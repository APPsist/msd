# APPsist Machine State Simulation Service (German: Maschinensimulationsdienst)

The MSD simulates a machine by sending Schema and DataMessages to APPsistREST running within mid. 

As other services of the APPsist project, the MSD is a module for the [Vert.x framework](http://vertx.io/vertx2/) (Version 2.1).
